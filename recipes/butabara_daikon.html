        <p>Butabara Daikon is a Japanese simmered dish made by cooking pork belly and daikon radish in a sweet and savory sauce. "Butabara" means pork belly, and "Daikon" refers to daikon radish. By simmering these two ingredients together, the rich flavor of the pork infuses into the daikon, creating a delightful combination.</p>
        <p>The seasoning is kept simple to complement the pork, using only dashi broth, soy sauce, and a small amount of sugar. Although it takes some time to simmer, the preparation process is straightforward.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g daikon radish</li>
            <li>150g thinly sliced pork belly</li>
            <li>15g ginger</li>
            <li>1 green onion</li>
            <li>400ml bonito dashi</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the daikon into 0.8 inch (2cm) thick rounds, then further divide each round into bite-sized pieces, either into sixths or eighths. Slice the pork belly into 0.8 inch (2cm) wide pieces. Peel the ginger and cut it into long, thin strips. Thinly slice the green onion.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the ginger and saut√©. Once the ginger becomes fragrant, add the pork belly and continue heating until it changes color. Next, add the daikon and cook everything together for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Pour the dashi into the pan and bring it to a boil. Then, skim off any scum, add sugar and soy sauce, and cover it with an otoshi-buta. Let it simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the otoshi-buta and continue simmering for about 15 minutes until the cooking liquid is reduced, leaving only a small amount in the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Serve in a bowl and sprinkle with the green onions.</li>
        </ol>
