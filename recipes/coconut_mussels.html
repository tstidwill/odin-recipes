        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 long red chilli, deseeded and chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, sliced</li>
            <li>1 stalk lemongrass</li>
            <li>400ml coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp rice wine</li>
            <li>1/4 teason saffron</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1kg mussels</li>
            <li>chopped coriander leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the mussels.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, one for which you have a lid, heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat. Cook the shallot, chilli and garlic until they soften and begin to take on some colour.</li>
            <li>Cut the lemongrass in half, lengthways, and chop into pieces. (If you don’t intend to strain the soup, make the pieces large enough to be easily retrieved.)</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk, rice wine, lemongrass and saffron, stirring until it comes to a simmer. At this point, you can remove it from the heat and let it infuse for 30 minutes, then pass through a fine sieve or chinois; this isn’t essential, just the way I do it.</li>
            <li>When the soup is simmering, add the lime juice and fish sauce. Taste, balancing as necessary.</li>
            <li>Add the mussels, pop on the lid and let it simmer away for at least 6 minutes. Take a quick peek before removing from the heat: most, if not all, of the mussels should have opened. If not, just put the lid back on and give them a little more time.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mussels to serving bowls with a skimmer or large slotted spoon, pour over the soup and sprinkle with coriander leaves. Serve immediately.</li>
